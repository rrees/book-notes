## Rotting Ice

A long piece about the change in lifestyle for subsistence hunters in Greenland resulting from climate change disrupting the winter sea ice.

The piece has a grim view about the future of a warming world.

## The bed-rest hoax

Lying in bed for long periods can be harmful to your health but it is still routinely recommended for expectant mothers in the US.

## The Siege of Miami

A fascinating account of the hydrology of Florida and why it is uniquely at risk from rising sea-levels. A real stand out piece in the collection.

## Tracking Ivory

A partial account of creating fake elephant tusks with tracking devices inside them to help discover more about the trade in illegal ivory.

The essay mostly describes how poached ivory has sustained the armed struggle of several groups in Africa including the Lord's Resistance Army. In also describes how countries like Sudan are complicit in the illegal trade and provide a safe-haven for violent raids into the reserves of other countries.

## Why sports bras are terrible

So it may be patriarchy or the rather specialist nature of the job of the sports bra but I haven't really it given it much thought before. This essay does the clever work to reveal the complexities and nuance of an unfamiliar subject and to delight you as it does so.

Breasts have no structural support within the body. They essentially sit on top of the muscles. To avoid discomfort and to help manage their movement it makes most sense to strap them tightly against the body. This is the essence of the sports bra.

## The Lost Girls

Women suffer from autism much less than men but we are still not sure why. Not only that but women seem to have different autistic traits.

The article is big on intersection, namely of gender and autism but it feels like actually what is lacking is research.

One of the interesting pieces of research raised in the article is that autistic women might be using their frontal lobes to process social behaviour, unlike men. They can intellectualise social interaction but at the cost of having to constantly, actively think about it.

One quote from one of the interviewees also struck an interesting chord with an [essay about David Hume](https://aeon.co/essays/hume-is-the-amiable-modest-generous-philosopher-we-need-today) I'm reading. Both the philosopher and the interviewee stated that study should not be something you are doing to the point of sickness. Whatever you are doing it should not be making you ill.
