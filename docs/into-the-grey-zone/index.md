# Into the grey zone

Alzheimer's patients have a sense of being something even if they have lost the sense of being somewhere or someone in particular.

People's personalities and behaviour are the combination of the physical health and operation of their brains and the emergent behaviour that is enabled by memory.

Around one in five people who had a clinical diagnosis of vegetative state were capable of responding to questions with thought and many were fully aware of what was going on around them but were unable to control their bodies.

People in a locked-in state were happier with their lives than healthy people who were asked whether they would be happy in that state.

Brains consist of the neurons and the links between them. Both are important but the results of losing one and not the other are still being explored.
