# If Then

The value of labour

The definition of fairness and what we mean by "fair".

Rather like the *The Handmaiden's Tale* the characters have memories of being *us* the reader at no real distance in time but decades of experience. For them our world is dream-like and unreal, giving us the chance to appreciate the pleasures and contempt we have for our own world.

The "Then" part of the book feels like a tonal break that comes too suddenly. Switching to a historical novel about the Gallipoli campaign, despite some of the foreshadowing just feels less interesting than what we have been asked to invest in.
