# Signs preceding the end of the world

The unusual term "verse" which crops in the book (initially I thought it was a shortening of "reverse" as the character verses out of various gangster's lairs in the opening chapters) is a translation of a neologism.

"Jarchar" is derived from the Arabic Kharja ("exit") a word used to describe vernacular verses attached to the end of classical poems in Moorish Andalucia. Bridges between the classical world and the proto-Spanish of the day.
